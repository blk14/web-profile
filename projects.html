                        &nbsp;The deposit is defined by a map[LIN][COL] configuration, there are N robots which are responsible for moving these boxes. Map[x][y] represents the number of boxes from a cell represented by (x, y) coordinates in deposit. They have to memorise all the commands in a queue until there is given an "EXECUTE" command and they have to execute the first command from the queue (so "EXECUTE" command is not memorised in the queue because it has the role to execute commands from queue). The robots are able to recognise and answer to commands of dropping and getting boxes (also, this type of commands come with a priority which tell if the command will go to the top of the queue or to the bottom), last executed command or how much time last executed command have stayed in the queue (the time is counted in how many commands have been added in the queue until the moment when the "last executed command" was executed)</p>

                        &nbsp;This application has the purpose to give the answer for 5 tasks which are frequently encountered in applications like google maps or waze. Based on some input data such as: <br><br>

                        &nbsp;1. A list of cities<br>
                        &nbsp;2. The roads between them (source - destination). The roads are unidirectional and the distance is 1 unity by default<br>
                        &nbsp;3. A list of cities with gas station. <br>
                        &nbsp;[4]. A list of cities and for each one I have to find out the cities with which it does not have a path/connection. <br>
                        &nbsp; [5]. A list of cars with the following details: the city where it is, how much gas does it have and the consumption per unity.<br>
                        &nbsp;[6]. A list of bus routes with the following details: source_city, destination_city and the number of travelers<br><br>

                        &nbsp;TASK 1: Is to find out the most crowded city. (the rule is that the most crowded city is the one which represent the destination for most roads)<br><br>

                        &nbsp;Task 2: Is to find out if the map is valid. (the rule is: if there is a road between each city the map is valid, the cost for this road doesn't matter, in other words if the map is a <strong>strongly connected component</strong> )<br><br>

                        &nbsp;Task 3: Is to take the list from [4] and find out a list for each city with inaccessible cities from it (there is not a path between them)<br><br>

                        &nbsp;Task 4: Is to take the list from [5] and find out for each car the closest gas station from another city (the shortest road to a city with gas station) and print "DA" if the car can arrive in a city with gas station and the remaining fuel, or "NU" if it can't.<br><br>

                        &nbsp;Task 5: Is to take the list from [6] and find out the route which is traveled by the most travelers, print the route and the number of travelers. It is known that every bus is going on the shortest route between 2 cities and the buses does not stop between source city and destination</p>

                <p id="projects-content">&nbsp;This is an implementation for the x&0 game in c++. For playing it, you have to choose if you want to start, then insert the coordinates for "x" (by default you play with x and my program with "0"). The implementation tries to win or to be very hard to be beaten. For it there is a check function which decide if the game is end.
                &nbsp; &bull;"Check" function checks each posibility for 3 elements to be in a row or if the board is full, in this cases result that the game is finished. <br>
                &nbsp; &bull; The function "fill" is the function which decide where to put the elements for my program and decides it based on the information given by the "danger" function which return the coordinates where there is a posibility to end the game (where there are 2 elements in a row and the player wait for the third). If there is not this danger the "fill" function tries to create a posibility like that and decide to put elements where is a perspective to put 3 in a row, if it is not possible too, then it put the element where it's possible. <br>
                &nbsp; &bull;So the program looks for safety first and decides if it has to do a defensive move, then it looks for an offensive move, lastly it would choose the remaining positions with no perspective. </p>

                <p id="projects-content">&nbsp;This is an application which simulates a real life situation from a hospital. Based on an input where you receive data about patients, such as: name, illness type, severity of the illness, the moment when they arrive at the hospital (for example the patient "X" arrives at the hospital in round 53), data about doctors (such as: name, specialzation, if he is a surgeon, self capacity to make treatment) and the number of nurses. <br>
                &nbsp;The application is able to send the patients in priority queues based on their illness type, severity and the status of the other patients who arrived at the same time or who are still in the queues. Then, based on the queues which are assigned to the doctors according to their specialization and the illness type of the patients, the doctors will take one patient per round. <br>
                &nbsp;The program is able to make decisions for doctors such as: treatment at home, treatment in the hospital (here the patients are consulted by the nurses periodically), to surgery (after surgery they are also kept in the hospital) or sent to technicians for detailed investigation, all of this decisions are based on mathematical equations and some constants. If the patients are sent to technicians, after this they are redistributed again in queues and the doctors respect the investigations results and they take decisions according to these results. <br>
                &nbsp;The application is using <strong>Observer</strong> pattern so the "road" of a patient is easier to follow. The application receives the number of rounds for which it should go on.</p>

                <p id="projects-content">&nbsp;This is the implementation of a Version Control System simulation which has the role to do a minimum set of unix instructions such as: create, change or delete files. Also, the application can do vcs instructions (such as: status, branch, commit, checkout, log or rollback) and is able to save the current state of the file system. The purpose of this application is to be able to come back to previous states of the file system. In this application you can create files, write something in, etc. <br>
                &nbsp;And all of these changes will be memorised in staging. Eventually if we give a commit command the staging area will be empty and the changes will be saved as a commit in a special array of commits (each branch has this type of array). Also, we can create branches. <br>
                &nbsp;This is a project in java and I used <strong>Visitor</strong> pattern where every type of command extends a class which "accept" a vistor class, from "accept" method is called the "visit" method from visitor, then from visitor is called "execute" method for that specific command. Visit method has an abstract class as parameter and this class is extended by every class which represent a command.</p>

                    &nbsp;The first component is the TCP client (subscriber) which represents a client who would want to subscribe to different topics. He can choose if he want to receive messages even though he is offline (he will receive all the collected messages, while he was offline, at once when he will be online back, similar with what is happening when we do not check our mail for a while). Or he can choose not to receive messages while he is offline.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;The second component is an UDP client which has the role to generate messages of different topics to the server. The topic is specified in the message.<br><br>
                    &nbsp;The third component is the server which has a UDP connection with the second component and a TCP connection with the first component where it uses multiplexing for dealing easily with many subscribers. It has the role to parse the UDP messages and the TCP connections and messages (in order to memorise the subscribers and their actions of subscribing or unsibscribing to the topics). It takes the messages from the UDP and sends them only to the clients which are subscribed to that topic. (It is similar with what gmail/yahoo does when a travel agency for example sends offers via email to their subscribers, what is more is that situation with online/offline choice of the subscribers).</p>
